# Massive MIMO Detection using MMSE-SIC and Expectation Propagation

### Term project - Wireless Communications [ECSE610] - McGill - Winter 2017

For the detection of large-scale MIMO systems, the following algorithms have been implemented, evaluated and compared:
- Minimum-Mean Squared Error (MMSE) detector
- MMSE with successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) algorithm
- Approximated Message Passing (AMP) algorithm
- Expecatation Propagation (EP) algorithm

The therotical modelization and results could be found in the [report](ECSE610F_Amen_Memmi.pdf).
